## Confirmshaming
This is when a company shames a user for doing a certain thing.
Example: User gets a pop-up to subscribe to a mailing list, and the only way to exit the pop-up is to click sometyhing that shames the user.

This is not a good thing and should be avoided.

## (Laws of XU)[https://lawsofux.com/]

Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that’s more usable.

**Aesthetic-Usability Effect**
- An aesthetically pleasing design creates a positive response in people’s brains and leads them to believe the design actually works better.
- People are more tolerant of minor usability issues when the design of a product or service is aesthetically pleasing.
- Visually pleasing design can mask usability problems and prevent issues from being discovered during usability testing.

**Doherty Threshold**
Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace (<400ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other.
- Provide system feedback within 400 ms in order to keep users’ attention and increase productivity.
- Use perceived performance to improve response time and reduce the perception of waiting.
- Animation is one way to visually engage people while loading or processing is happening in the background.
- Progress bars help make wait times tolerable, regardless of their accuracy.
- Purposefully adding a delay to a process can actually increase its perceived value and instill a sense of trust, even when the process itself actually takes much less time.

**Fitts’s Law**
The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.
- Touch targets should be large enough for users to accurately select them.
- Touch targets should have ample spacing between them.
- Touch targets should be placed in areas of an interface that allow them to be easily acquired.

**Goal-Gradient Effect**
The tendency to approach a goal increases with proximity to the goal.
- The closer users are to completing a task, the faster they work towards reaching it.
- Providing artificial progress towards a goal will help to ensure users are more likely to have the motivation to complete that task.
- Provide a clear indication of progress in order to motivate users to complete tasks.

**Hick’s Law**
The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.
- Minimize choices when response times are critical to increase decision time.
- Break complex tasks into smaller steps in order to decrease cognitive load.
- Avoid overwhelming users by highlighting recommended options.
- Use progressive onboarding to minimize cognitive load for new users.
- Be careful not to simplify to the point of abstraction.

**Jakob’s Law**
Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.
- Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that appears similar.
- By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the users can focus on their tasks rather than on learning new models.
- When making changes, minimize discord by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited time.

**Law of Common Regions**
Elements tend to be perceived into groups if they are sharing an area with a clearly defined boundary.
- Common region creates a clear structure and helps users quickly and effectively understand the relationship between elements and sections.
- Adding a border around an element or group of elements is an easy way to create common region.
- Common region can also be created by defining a background behind an element or group of elements.

## How to Fix 8 Common Design Mistakes
Visual content is a crucial ingredient in your content marketing, as studies have shown it’s more likely to be shared, clicked on, and engaged with.

- When you think of visual content, always remember the content. Establish a coherent and obvious visual hierarchy to help guide your reader through. Otherwise, your message will get lost.
- Stick to a grid. These measurements will help you determine where to place everything as you build out your visual content.
- Colors can either bring your visual content to life or leave it in disarray.
- Use illustrations wisely and purposely. 
- Carefully laying out and presenting type is key. Both the placement and variety of fonts you choose impact the quality of your visual content.
- Ensuring accurate representation and reliable data can make or break your visual content.
- Think through where you need icons and where you need words.

## Dialog Design
A dialog is an overlay that requires the user to interact with it and designed to elicit a response from the user.

- Use dialogs sparingly because they are interruptive.
- Dialog should speak the users’ language (use words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user), rather than special system terms.
- You shouldn’t try to cram too much into a dialog. Keep it clean and simple 
- Dialogs come in two main types. 
  - First type are attention seeking modal dialogs which force a user to interact with them before continuing. 
  - Second type is non-modal dialog which allow users to click or tap outside of them to dismiss them.
- You should use modal dialogs (the first type) only for very important interactions (e.g. delete account, agree to the terms and conditions).
- When opening an dialog it’s important that the page behind is slightly darkened.
