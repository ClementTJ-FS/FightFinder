## Style Tile
- When to use style tiles?
  - Style tiles are for when a moodboard is too vague and a comp is too literal. Style tiles establish a direct connection with actual interface elements without defining layout.
- How to use style tiles?
  1. Listen to the client.
  - Have a design kickoff meeting.
  - Ask questions.
  2. Interpret
  - Aggregate adjectives from the answer process, identify themes and sort similarities.
  - Break down Client Feedback.
  3. Define a Visual Language.
  - This is the actual process of composing the style tile. 
  - Determine themes from the aggregated adjectives and begin to match them up with styles.
  - Style Tiles give the client a point of reference to determine if you both are on the same page.
  4. Iterate.
  - Making changes in style out of the context of layout takes less time and allows you to work faster.

## Colors
- Color is a key component of your business’s branding, and also helps communicate important messaging to users as they interact with your site.

- Usde Color psychology.
### What different colors mean:
  - Red: A bold color that evokes a strong emotion. With its intensity, it creates a sense of urgency.
  - Orange: Cheerful and confident, orange conveys the idea of enthusiasm. However, it can come off as the color of caution as well.
  - Yellow: Like orange, yellow provides a cheerful feeling. It represents optimism and is usually attention grabbing. One thing to consider, however, is that some shades can strain the eye.
  - Green: Represents growth and nature. It signifies health, serenity, and tranquility. It is associated with wealth.
  - Blue: This color is associated with water, and provides a feeling of calmness and serenity. Blue creates a sense of security and trust, and is often used for corporations.
  - Turquoise: Sophisticated and also associated with healing.
  - Purple: The color of wealth and success. It’s a powerful color, but also represents creativity.
  - Brown: Friendly, earthy, and commonly represents the outdoors.
  - Black: A color with a sophisticated feeling. It’s often what we think of with “sleek” brands because of its exclusivity and mystery.
  - Gray: Provides a feeling of security, reliability, and intelligence.
  - White: Provides a clean or neutral feeling. It’s a key color because it adds breathing room and what is referred to as “white space.”
- It’s important to make sure that the color scheme will work for all users on your site.

## Textures
- Approaches:
  - Go Simple and Understated
  - Go Big and Bold
  - Incorporate a Trend
  - Use an Image
  - Use Color Variations
  - Gradient
  - Animate 
- A great background texture can add depth and visual interest to your overall website design.
- The trick to using textures is that they have to be subtle and actually fall into the background so that foreground elements are easy to read and understand.
