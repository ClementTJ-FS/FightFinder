[Good users — bad users: from use cases to misuse cases](https://uxdesign.cc/good-users-bad-users-from-use-cases-to-misuse-cases-cd4cc0424e3a)

Talks about how users can be either good or bad, and how we need to adjust our approach. It also talks about picking a good problem to solve and how to refine our approach.

* Use Cases: are the examples of users of our products that use the product as we wanted.
* Misuse Cases: The users are not the ones we would expect to use our platform, but people who abuse it either intentionally or unintentionally.
* It is not necessarily that the percentage of bad player to good players is what will matter, it is the impact that this group has on the health of you product.

## Uniqueness in Your Idea: Building a Better Mousetrap

How to pick a good idea.

* Creative ideas, by their very nature, invite judgment. People need to know if the value promised by the new is worth the abandonment of the old.
* It’s not enough to merely generate great ideas.
*  It’s not enough for people to learn how to be more creative; they also need to be persistent through the rejection they might face.

[15 Questions to Help Define Your Target Audience](https://medium.com/@edkentmedia/15-questions-to-help-you-define-your-target-audience-1ffcdcfee059)
How to find your target market.

* Before you can be successful with any business endeavour, you need to do a complete target market analysis to determine your ideal customer.
* Creating a target market profile is often the most overlooked. But if you don’t take this step then your response rates will be low and you will likely waste a significant amount of money.
* What are their biggest objections to using your service or product?
This may be the most crucial question you need to answer. Without answering this question, you will never get the conversions for your business that you want and expect.

## Market Segmentation and Your Users
[The 6 types of user segmentation and what they mean for your product](https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-think-segmentation-from-day-1-f714df093ccb)
Understand your users, develop a market segmentation plan, position your product, and create a value proposition

* Marketing segmentation is marketing strategy that involves dividing a broad target market into subsets of consumers who have common needs, wants, demand, or characteristics.
* # Market Segmentation Practices:
  - 1. Behavioural
      - Behavioural segmentation considers a few things such as the knowledge of your product. Users attitude towards your product. 
      - How and how often they use your product or how they respond to your product. Their loyalty to the product.
      - You can also think about creating a segment based on what your customers will benefit from the product.
      - Behavioural segmentation is a great place to start when you think about segmenting your market.
  - 2. Psychographic
      - This segmentation is achieved by studying activities, interests, and the opinions of your customers.
  - 3. Demographic
      - The demographic segmentation is based on your customers demographics characteristics. 
      - Things like age, gender, occupation, education level, income level and much more.
  - 4. Geographic
      - This segmentation is based on geographic areas such as a country, regions, different cities, or postal codes.
  - 5. Occasional
      - The occasional segmentation focuses on certain occasions that are completely independent of customer.
      - You don’t care at all about demographics and you just care about occasions such as going out for ice cream, taking a vacation, or as Coke famously did it, being thirsty.
      - Coke’s campaign doesn’t care if you are a man, woman, living in Uruguay or Romania or if you have high socio-economic status or low. All they care about is are you thirsty; it’s very simple.
  - 6. Cultural
      - With this you’ll classify the markets according to the cultural origin.
      - When you use cultural segmentation, you’ll be able to communicate well with a given culture in the most effective way.
