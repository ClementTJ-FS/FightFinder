# Tech Stack

Fill out the headings below with your familiarly and comfort level with each piece of technology.


## Adobe XD

You are going to be using XD to create click-through designs of your application. It is recommended that you use an UI kit for a visual framework to help you design your applications as similarly to the potential live version as possible.

**How comfortable do you feel with XD?**
At this point, I feel pretty comfortable with XD. I have used it to create a few prototypes throughout the entire program and I have been able to get a good understanding of its features.

**What are your concerns around using XD?**
I don't have many concerns about using XD itself, but I do have some concerns about which UI Kit to use. I feel like some parts of certain kits are really nice and fit what I'm looking for, but others are not, so customizing certain components might be necessary.

## React

You will be utilizing React as your front-end framework. You will be expected to use moduleCSS, PropTypes, and an ESLint style guide.

**How comfortable do you feel with React?**
I am moderately comfortable with React. Having used it throughout the course, I understand key concepts such as modularity, state, and props. I feel like I can get React to do what I need it to do, although I am not sure if I am using it the best way.

**What are your concerns around using React?**
Some things I am expected to use, like PropTypes and ESLint style guides. These are unfortunately things that have been glossed over in the course, so they are more things I need to research.

## Redux

Redux will be used to control your data and have proper data flow for your app. You will be expected to create well organized reducers, well built actions, and connected components.

Haven't used it. Hasn't been brought up in the course. Although, I have watched a tutorial video on it and can probably get it to work.

**What are your concerns around using Redux?**
This is something else that has, unfortunately, been glossed over in the course. I need to research it more.

Pretty comfortable with Node. I have used it throughout the course and I understand the key concepts of best practices, npm, and npx.

None really.

## Express

You will be using express as your framework for your API. You will be using and building middleware, routes, controllers, sending and receiving JSON data.

**How comfortable do you feel with Express?**
Like node, express is something I am pretty comfortable using. I have created a couple APIs during the course and I understand the key concepts.

**What are your concerns around using Express?**
None.
